										<h3>COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES</h3>
										<p>Like most online services, we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies to provide and personalize
											the Service, analyse use, target advertisements and prevent fraud. You can disable cookies in your browser

											administrative, technical and physical security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access or
